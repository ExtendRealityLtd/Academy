# Using Oculus Integration

Oculus Integration is the official SDK from [Oculus](https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/unity-integration/) and provides a comprehensive way to develop for hardware produced by Oculus, however the SDK can also be used on other supported platforms as well. The [Oculus Integration](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/oculus-integration-82022) package can be obtained from the Unity Asset Store.

Go to the Unity Asset Store by selecting `Main Menu -> Window -> Asset Store` or pressing `CTRL + 9` and search for `Oculus Integration`. Alternatively, click this direct link to [Oculus Integration](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/oculus-integration-82022) on the Unity Asset Store. Download and import the Oculus Integration Unity Asset into your project.

> Note: Oculus Integration requires the Unity software API Compatibility Level set to `.Net 4.x`. See [this forum post](https://forums.oculusvr.com/developer/discussion/73172/oculus-integration-for-unity-v1-34-01-31-19) for more details.
