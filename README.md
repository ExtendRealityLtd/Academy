## Welcome

VRTK.Documentation is a curriculum of educational content to provide
a complete understanding of VRTK and how to utilize it to build great
solutions for spatial computing.

It is aimed at all levels from complete beginners to advanced
developers to provide a learning curve to fully understand all that is
on offer.

## Documentation

The documentation is split into four main sections:

### How-to Guides
<sup>_[Goal Oriented]_</sup>

These are step by step instructions on how to set up specific features offered by VRTK.

 * [View How-to Guides](Documentation/HowToGuides/README.md)

### Tutorials
<sup>_[Learning Oriented]_</sup>

These are small to medium projects that go from an empty state to a completed goal that
shows how to use features within VRTK to build specific solutions.
